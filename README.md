I will create a simple Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. Here's the plan:

1. Create a `main.py` file that will be the entry point of the game.
2. Create a `snake.py` file that will contain the Snake class.
3. Create a `food.py` file that will contain the Food class.
4. Create a `game.py` file that will contain the Game class, which will handle the game logic and rendering.
5. Create a `requirements.txt` file to list the required packages.

Now, let's start implementing the code for each file.

main.py
